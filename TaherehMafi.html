      <h2>Occupation</h2>
            <p>
Occupation:  Tahereh Mafi the author of the New York Times bestselling trilogy, Shatter Me. She was the youngest child with four older brothers in a small city somewhere in Connecticut. She currently resides in Orange County, California. Mafi graduated from a tiny liberal arts college two miles from the shores of Laguna Beach, has varying levels of competency in eight different languages, and spent a semester abroad in Barcelona, Spain, where she had the opportunity to study Spanish literature in its native form. Millions of eyes are waiting for the next Tahereh Mafi new series of novels that would be just as loved as Shatter Me. Nothing can be definitely said about Tahereh Mafi upcoming books, but indeed, Tahereh Mafi literary agent will do as good a job as he did previously.
