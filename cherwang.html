      <h2>Occupation</h2>
            <p>
Occupation:  Cher Wang is a Taiwanese entrepreneur and philanthropist born in Taipei, Taiwan. As co-founder and chairperson (since 2007) of HTC Corporation (which manufactured one out of every six smartphones sold in the United States) and integrated chipset maker VIA Technologies. She is considered one of the most powerful and successful women in technology. Wang's father was Wang Yung-ching, founder of the plastics and petrochemicals conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group and one of the wealthiest individuals in Taiwan before his death in 2008. As of 2014, she is listed as the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes. She joined First International Computer (FIC) in 1982. Wang and others founded VIA in 1987 and HTC in 1997. In May 2011, Forbes ranked her with husband Wen Chi Chen as the wealthiest person in Taiwan, with a net worth of US$8.8 billion. In August 2012, Wang was named #56 on Forbes' list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.[9] As of 2014, she is listed as the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes.[5]

In Oct. 2014, Cher Wang refused to accept the Final Award of the "HKIAC / A11022 arbitration" and appealed to the Hong Kong High Court (Case No.:HCCT40 / 2014) before Judge Mimmie Chan. Wang asserted that the Award was contrary to public policy. VIA product VT3421, an anti-hack chip (also named asTF376) was suspected in assisting the Chinese government of surveilling mobile devices of anti-communist and human rights activists. VIA executive Li Shaolun (Steven S. Lee) admitted in the proceedings that VIA chips did have "back door". The Hong Kong HKIAC sentenced VIA with compensation. In a hearing before the Justice Mimmie Chan, in the High Court of Hong Kong, she said she believed the Award was in violation of Hong Kong's public order and morals. In June 2015 in she remised the case back to Arbitrator Anthony Neoh. The tribunal upheld the conviction in October 2015, and VIA lost the case for millions of dollars.</p>
